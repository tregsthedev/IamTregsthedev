# You've found my Github Profile
My name is Arav Narula, a 14 year old somphere in Canada. I have a love and hate relationship with code. I was first introudued to programming with scratch at the age of 9, and later introduced to other programming lanuages on the scratch foums. I've always found computers and techongly intresting, there's a whole world of possibltes, ideas, and things to learn. It's a endless process of discovery, and creation. When I was first introduced to Javascript, It didn't make sense. This really made it diffcult for me for a couple years to program, fueled by my impatience, and wantig to do more. Until a while ago, even though I've had a intrest in programming and computers, I douldn't say I loved it. Everything changed when I joined Hack Club, introduced to python, and attended Hack Club Assemble (my first hackathon)
